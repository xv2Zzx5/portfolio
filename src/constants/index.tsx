    about: `Hello! 
My name is Sinan and I specialize in web developement that utilizes HTML, CSS, JS, and REACT etc.
I am a highly motivated individual and eternal optimist dedicated to writing clear, concise, robust code that works. Striving to never stop learning and improving.
When I'm not coding, I am writing bolgs, reading, or picking up some new hands-on art project like photography.
I like to have my perspective and belief systems challenged so that I see the world through new eyes.`,
